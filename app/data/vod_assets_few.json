    "synopsis": "Widely regarded as Hitchcock's greatest work, this hypnotic mystery stars James Stewart as \u2018Scottie' Ferguson, a height-fearing ex-cop who is asked by an old friend to follow his oddly-behaving wife (Kim Novak). His curiosity leads to obsession, with devastating consequences. But that's only half the story. A haunting, striking and utterly compelling masterclass of technique and storytelling, Vertigo is so good it'll make your head spin.",
    "body": "Psycho delivered the shocks, North By Northwest the thrills and Rebecca the Oscar, but if one film can lay claim to the title of The Master's masterpiece, it's Vertigo.\nA seamless combination of psychological mystery, twisted romance, surrealism and technical innovation, it's the perfect embodiment of the Hitchcock motto: to mesmerise, unnerve and discombobulate.\nIn what was to be his last Hitch-up (his age was cited for the film's lukewarm box office), Stewart plays former San Francisco detective John Ferguson, whose nickname 'Scottie' is never explained... unlike his early retirement, the result of a rooftop chase during which Scottie - paralysed by acrophobia - watched helplessly as a fellow officer fell to his death.\nWhile his best friend Midge (Bel Geddes) helps him overcome both his condition and his guilty conscience, Scottie is contacted by Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore), an old college buddy who wants him to follow his wife Madeleine (Novak).\nGavin is driven not by suspicion but concern. It seems that Madeleine is possessed by the spirit of an ancestor who committed suicide; visiting her grave, returning to her old home, and gazing for hours at her portrait in an art gallery.\nBut the observer is forced to turn saviour when Madeleine throws herself into San Francisco Bay. Beguiled and now completely besotted, he vows to solve the mystery and end her psychological torment forever.\nHis endeavours meet with tragic success.\nMonths later, Scottie is a haunted man. But a chance encounter on the street suggests that history is about to repeat itself...\nHaving written the source novel for the twisty French classic Les Diaboliques, authors Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac allegedly had Hitchcock in mind when they wrote the book D'entre les Morts (Back From The Dead) on which Vertigo is based. Deception and obsession are on the agenda once again.\nOften accused of treating actors like cattle, Hitchcock nevertheless brought out the best from his performers, particularly his leading ladies who were often cast for their (invariably blonde) looks over their acting ability.\nThe glacial Novak was never - and would never be - better than in her dual role here, while Barbara Bel Geddes may forever be remembered as Miss Ellie from Dallas, but her portrayal the loyal, loving Midge is a far worthier legacy.\nAnd while Stewart may have been a tad long in the tooth to convincingly sweep Novak off her feet, this is still one of his most layered performances, encompassing guilt, sadness, and an obsession that verges on the pitiable.\nIt's also impossible not to be seduced by Bernard Herrmann's marvellous score and the superb use of locations in and around San Francisco.\nOn top of all this, the film opened a cinematic box of tricks which are still used today, from Hitch's dizzying zoom in/pull back manoeuvre (capturing Scottie's acrophobia) to artist John Ferren's dream sequence, the influence of which can be seen in TV title sequences as diverse as Doctor Who and Mad Men.\nHitch freely admitted to plot developments that don't quite add up and leaving the odd loose end (think back to the hotel). He called them 'fridge moments', because if he'd done his job right, viewers would be so absorbed they would be safely home before they worked them out.\nBut make no mistake, Vertigo represents The Master at the height of his powers.",

As a polished \u201cwho decided it\", this is an intriguing entry point into a fascinating period of Japanese/American history.",
    "body": "The investigation into Hirohito\u2019s war crimes complicity is a detective story worthy of Dashiell Hammett.\nSecluded in his heavily guarded palace, the emperor is protected by the heavy cloak of Japanese reticence in deference to their \u201cliving God\u201d, with numerous governmental flunkies (including Prime Minister Tojo) refusing to incriminate the figurehead.\nAll this is set against the backdrop of a country bombed into the Stone Age, with a shattered populace teetering on the brink of desperate anarchy. An anarchy that will erupt if the emperor is hung as a war criminal, but Washington is crying out for a conviction to appease voters baying for blood.\nThis component parts are present and correct in Emperor, but director Peter Webber cannot capture the momentousness of the period, falling back on the \u201cslot A into tab B\u201d dramatics in Vera Blasi and David Klass\u2019 script.\nFox\u2019s General Fellers is charged with uncovering the truth about Hirohito\u2019s culpability and ticks all politically sensitive boxes. An expert in Japanese culture and psychology following a pre-war liaison with a Japanese love interest (Hatsune), for whom he searches in the post-war rubble, Fox\u2019s expository role is heavy on dialogue labouring points about Japan\u2019s warrior spirit, honour and rigid rules of conduct.\nGolden-hued flashbacks to the lost love dissipate what little tension Webber can muster and there is little variation on the tight-lipped officials scenes that unfold one after the next until Fellers reaches someone willing to talk.\nTommy Lee Jones has more fun as the larger-than-life MacArthur, a man full of bravado and \u201cAmerican swagger\u201d who shrewdly distances himself from the investigation lest it ruin his Presidential campaign hopes.\nTokyo\u2019s devastated landscape is effectively rendered and flashbacks to the militaristic government\u2019s response to Hirohito\u2019s decision to surrender suggest a far more interesting story waits to be told.\nUndemanding, handsome and played with conviction, but sorely missing any sense of urgency.",

    "synopsis": "Almost fifteen years after providing a box office hit with The Best Man, Morris Chestnut, Taye Diggs, Regina Hall and the rest of their group of upwardly mobile African-Americans are back. In the intervening years, there have been marriages, births and divorces... and now they're all getting back for the Christmas holidays. Long-forgotten romances - and rivalries - are re-ignited as the wine flows. Speech!",
    "body": "Back in 1999,writer-director Malcolm D Lee hit box office gold with The Best Man, a cliche-free depiction of aspirational, middle class black Americans whose inspiration was less Shaft and more graft.\nWhen we left them Morris Chestnut's New York Giants running back Lance had just married Mia (Calhoun) despite her admitting an affair with Lance's best bud Harper (Diggs).\nFast-forward a decade and a half and there's still bad blood between Lance and Harper and the latter's career as a writer is on the wane and he's been fired from his university teaching job.\nHowever, he hits on the the sneaky idea of accepting an invite to a Christmas house party from Lance and Mia at their tacky mansion so that he can gather material for a warts'n'all unauthorised biography of the unsuspecting Giants star.\nDespite Lee's occasional tendency to soggy melodrama, his original film was a wry, entertaining take on a demographic previously overlooked -the black middle class - and spawned a whole flurry of similarly-themed fare, from the trite romance of Baggage Claim to the sharp, mating-game-turns-to-war comedy Think Like A Man.\nThis rom-com-dram take on The Big Chill isn't quite up there with Lee's debut but it never succumbs to the grim sudsiness waded through in Tyler Perry territory.\nWhere it does succeed is in the quality of the acting, particularly Terrence Howard's slightly ridiculous player Quentin, a nicely-played comedy distraction when the romantic drama is getting a tad too mawkish.\nLarger-than-life performances in a movie that deals in broad brush strokes also include Melissa De Sousa's Shelby, a upholstered bombshell and successful businesswoman who bitchily resents the former stripper who snared \"her man\".\nBut it's the fractured bromance between Chestnut and Diggs, a richly-worked love-hate relationship that provides the movie's real emotional ballast, an authentic test for a God-fearing alpha male to forgive his oldest friend.",
